#  Fitness Tracker Application

This is a **full-stack Fitness Tracker application** designed to help users track their daily fitness activities and health-related data. The project focuses on building a structured backend with a clean API and a user-friendly frontend.
I primarily **contributed to the backend development**, implementing RESTful APIs using **Node.js and Express.js** and integrating **MongoDB** for data storage. My work involved designing routes, handling requests and responses, and ensuring clean and efficient data flow.
This project helped me gain practical experience in **backend development**, API design, and database integration in a real-world application setup.
